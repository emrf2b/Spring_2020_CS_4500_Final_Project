Project Name:  
~ Building Functionality for Plan-To-Plate 
  
Project Description:  
~ We are dedicated to making Plan-To-Plate functional and  
user ready. Emily's idea is for the app Plan-To-Plate to  
help busy people take the hassle out of meal planning and  
budgeting. Her vision that we will attempt to bring to life  
includes the user being able to import recipes to the app,  
check local grocers for items in the recipes that are on sale,  
find that week's most budget conscious meal plan, and share  
photos of prepared meals.
